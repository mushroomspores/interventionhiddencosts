    At this point, you may be appalled by the amount of money that has been spent on all this furniture (just as I was). Before we decide what this means to us, I think it's good to have more information on hand. The following is information that I was kindly provided with from the school:
  </div>
    <br>
  <div id="notetext2">
    (1) SAIC receives 40%-50% off of the list price for these lines of furniture. Since all of these items were purchased when the Neiman Center was opened 8 years ago, due to the large volume of furniture purchased for this project, the school likely saw the full 50% savings.
      <br/>
      <br/>
    (2) All of these items were purchased in 2012 and that current list prices are going to be higher than they were 8 years ago. A 2% escalation rate per year would be a safe metric to use in estimating 2012 costs.
      <br/>
      <br/>
    (3) While the price tags on these pieces of furniture can be high, SAIC goes with them for a couple of reasons: 1. They are structurally and aesthetically sound , which allows the school to re-upholster rather than throw away. 2. SAIC tries to make furniture decisions with environmental impact in mind.

    This definitely influenced my thoughts on the matter to some extent. I wonder what it does for you. Whatever the case may be, thanks for spending time with my work. :)
